<!--
    iOS URL Scheme Configuration

    Add this to your iOS app's Info.plist file to register the custom URL scheme.
    Location: ios/App/App/Info.plist

    This tells iOS that your app can handle URLs with the "workosauthdemo://" scheme.
    When WorkOS redirects to "workosauthdemo://callback?code=...", iOS will:
    1. Intercept the URL
    2. Launch or bring your app to foreground
    3. Fire the appUrlOpen event with the URL

<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>com.workos.authdemo</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>workosauthdemo</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>

<!--
    Capacitor will automatically add this when you run `cap sync ios`
    if you have configured the scheme in capacitor.config.ts:

    ios: {
      scheme: 'workosauthdemo'
    }

    But you can also add it manually if needed.
