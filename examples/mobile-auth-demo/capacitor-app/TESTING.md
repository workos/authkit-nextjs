# Testing in iOS Simulator

The demo works in the iOS simulator without any modifications.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode installed
- Node.js installed
- Backend server running

## Setup Steps

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your WorkOS credentials:
```
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_test_...
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
```

Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Keep this running. You should see:
```
üöÄ WorkOS Mobile Auth Demo Backend
üì° Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Configure WorkOS Dashboard

Add the redirect URI to your WorkOS application:

1. Go to [WorkOS Dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com/)
2. Select your application
3. Go to Configuration ‚Üí Redirect URIs
4. Add: `workosauthdemo://callback`
5. Save

### 3. Setup the Capacitor App

```bash
cd capacitor-app
npm install
```

**Important:** The config is already set for simulator testing:
- `BACKEND_URL: 'http://localhost:3001'` works in iOS simulator
- URL scheme `workosauthdemo://` is pre-configured

Build the web assets:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Add iOS Platform (First Time Only)

```bash
npx cap add ios
```

This creates the `ios/` directory with Xcode project.

### 5. Sync Assets and Configuration

```bash
npm run sync:ios
```

This:
- Copies your built web assets to the iOS app
- Registers the custom URL scheme in Info.plist
- Updates Capacitor configuration

### 6. Open in Xcode

```bash
npm run open:ios
```

Or manually:
```bash
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

**Important:** Always open the `.xcworkspace` file, not `.xcodeproj`.

### 7. Run in Simulator

1. In Xcode, select a simulator from the device dropdown (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro)
2. Click the ‚ñ∂ Play button (or Cmd+R)
3. Wait for the build and simulator to launch

The app should open in the simulator.

## Testing the OAuth Flow

1. **Click "Sign In with WorkOS"**
   - Safari should open within the simulator
   - You'll see the WorkOS AuthKit login page

2. **Create an account or sign in**
   - Use any email (test mode doesn't require verification)
   - Complete any MFA if configured

3. **Observe the callback**
   - Safari may close automatically (platform-dependent)
   - Your app should come to the foreground
   - You'll see "Authentication successful!"
   - User information is displayed

4. **Test token refresh**
   - Click "Refresh Token"
   - Should succeed without re-authentication

5. **Test sign out**
   - Click "Sign Out"
   - Should return to login screen
   - Tokens are cleared

## Debugging

### Check Console Logs

In Xcode, open the debug console (Cmd+Shift+C) to see logs:

```
üöÄ Starting OAuth flow...
üìù Authorization URL generated
üåê Browser opened with authorization URL
üì± App URL opened: workosauthdemo://callback?code=...
‚úÖ OAuth callback received
  Code: 01ABCDEF...
üîÑ Exchanging authorization code for tokens...
‚úÖ Tokens received
üíæ Tokens stored
```

These logs show each step of the flow.

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid redirect_uri" Error

**Symptom:** Error in WorkOS after authentication

**Cause:** Redirect URI not configured in WorkOS Dashboard

**Fix:**
1. Go to WorkOS Dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Redirect URIs
2. Add: `workosauthdemo://callback`
3. Try again

#### Backend Connection Error

**Symptom:** "Failed to fetch" or network error after callback

**Cause:** Backend not running or wrong URL

**Fix:**
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
2. In simulator, `localhost` should work
3. Check Xcode console for exact error

#### App Doesn't Come to Foreground

**Symptom:** Safari stays open after auth

**Cause:** Normal behavior - callback still works

**Solution:**
- Manually return to the app
- The callback should have been processed
- Check if user info appeared

#### URL Scheme Not Registered

**Symptom:** Safari shows "Cannot open page" for workosauthdemo://

**Cause:** Capacitor sync didn't update Info.plist

**Fix:**
```bash
npm run sync:ios
```

Then rebuild in Xcode.

#### Browser Opens But Nothing Happens

**Symptom:** WorkOS page loads but login doesn't work

**Cause:** WorkOS configuration issue

**Fix:**
1. Check your WorkOS Client ID is correct
2. Verify the environment (test vs production)
3. Try in a real browser first to isolate mobile-specific issues

### Inspecting the iOS App

View the Info.plist to confirm URL scheme is registered:

```bash
cat ios/App/App/Info.plist | grep -A 5 CFBundleURLTypes
```

Should show:
```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>workosauthdemo</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Simulator vs Real Device

### What Works the Same:
- OAuth flow
- Custom URL scheme callbacks
- Token exchange
- Everything else

### What Might Differ:
- Browser behavior (Safari vs SFSafariViewController)
- Performance
- Some native features

**For this demo, everything works identically in the simulator.**

## Making Changes

If you modify the code:

1. Rebuild web assets:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Sync to iOS:
   ```bash
   npm run sync:ios
   ```

3. Rebuild in Xcode (Cmd+B) or just run (Cmd+R)

**Note:** For TypeScript/CSS changes, you must rebuild and sync. The iOS app doesn't hot-reload.

## Next Steps

After confirming it works in simulator:

1. **Test on a real device** (optional)
   - Requires developer account for code signing
   - Flow is identical

2. **Customize for your app**
   - Change URL scheme in `capacitor.config.ts`
   - Update redirect URI in WorkOS Dashboard
   - Modify `src/config.ts` with your backend URL

3. **Implement in your project**
   - Copy `src/auth.ts` as reference
   - Use the same Capacitor plugins
   - Follow the same patterns

## Confirming Everything Works

You know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Backend health check responds: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
2. ‚úÖ App launches in simulator
3. ‚úÖ Safari opens when you click "Sign In"
4. ‚úÖ WorkOS login page loads
5. ‚úÖ After auth, app comes to foreground
6. ‚úÖ User info is displayed
7. ‚úÖ Console shows all log messages
8. ‚úÖ Refresh token works

If any step fails, check the debugging section above.
